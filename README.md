## Contributing to The Project

Anyone who wishes to add positive contribution to this project is more than welcome. But the following two things must be kept in mind before contributing. 

 1. You need a working `.env` file for the backend of this system to work. You can ask for this file from the project manager or create one yourself for testing purposes.
 2. This application is fully configured to run in a docker container, so, it is advised not to modify configuration files as it will cause the future deployments to fail.
